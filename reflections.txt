How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?

It showed me exactly where the difference was in the code. Made it obvious.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It could allow you to branch off into different experimental solutions to problems without risking volumes of code along the way. It could allow you to "step" through the whole process.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: Can choose logically good choices of when to commit the fuckin things or whatever the fuck. Chicken fingers.

Cons: You have to remember to do it and make the choice on your own. 


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because when you're working on large programs you're likely to have multiple files. It just makes gosh darn sense.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You type them in the fucking thing and then you read the fucking results that's how.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It allows you to experiment and make mistakes without losing your changes in the mix! Keeps records. I likes it.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use Git for PROGRAMMING WEB PAGES! and maybe for writing a book some day!!
