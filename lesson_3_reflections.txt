When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a different computer for example.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

Because other people might be working on the project. I'm just making shit up I do'nt like doing these reflections. I learn by doing. I'll reflect on my own time.
