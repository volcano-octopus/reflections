When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working on a different computer for example.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

Because other people might be working on the project. I'm just making shit up I do'nt like doing these reflections. I learn by doing. I'll reflect on my own time.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks fork from projects and you can like work on it without fucking with other epoples shit. Clones duplicate it all up in your system. Branches are like a branch off of your project that you can fuck around with and experiment on. Like, forks pull the whole project. Whatever just google ittttt.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It allows you to work on stuff offline in a more up to date verison.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

You would sit at a table and yell across the table at each other. It would be way easier.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Separate branch when you wanna not fuck up the master. Separate: you won't fuck up master. Master: you can not deal with potential conflicts or some shit.
